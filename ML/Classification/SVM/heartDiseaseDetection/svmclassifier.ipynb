    "# Support Vector Machine (SVM) \n",
    "It is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification tasks, but it can also be used for regression. SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of SVM\n",
    "Hyperplane:\n",
    "\n",
    "In an n-dimensional space, a hyperplane is a flat affine subspace of dimension (n-1) that separates the space into two half-spaces. For a 2-dimensional space, the hyperplane is a line; for a 3-dimensional space, it is a plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane and influence its position and orientation. These are the critical elements of the training set.\n",
    "Margin:\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from either class. SVM aims to maximize this margin to achieve better generalization.\n",
    "#### Kernel Trick:\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel trick allows SVM to handle non-linearly separable data by transforming the original feature space into a higher-dimensional space where a linear hyperplane can separate the classes. \n",
    "Common kernels include:\n",
    "Linear Kernel: Suitable for linearly separable data.\n",
    "Polynomial Kernel: Allows for curved decision boundaries.\n",
    "Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel: Suitable for more complex, non-linear data.\n",
    "Sigmoid Kernel: Similar to a neural network's activation function.\n",
    "How SVM Works\n",
    "#### Linear SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "For linearly separable data, SVM finds a hyperplane that separates the classes with the maximum margin. The hyperplane is defined by the equation \n",
    "𝑤⋅𝑥+𝑏=0\n",
    "w⋅x+b=0, where \n",
    "𝑤\n",
    "w is the weight vector and \n",
    "𝑏\n",
    "b is the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Linear SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-linearly separable data, SVM uses kernel functions to map the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear hyperplane can separate the classes. This is known as the \"kernel trick.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Soft Margin SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM can handle cases where classes are not perfectly separable by introducing slack variables that allow some misclassification. The goal is to find a balance between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors. This is controlled by a regularization parameter 𝐶.\n"

    "### Non-Linear Kernel: \n",

    "### Kernel Trick: \n",
    "Allows SVMs to perform classification in a higher-dimensional space without explicitly computing the transformation."
